# models_from_scratch
Creating statistical models from scratch.

I wanted to understand and implement the optimization process of statistical models better and decided to try it out physically.

- The linear regression was made to try out the implementation of gradients manually and visualizing the optimization.
- The neural network implementation was inspired by a similar project I saw on YouTube.
